This will allow the SRE team to do seamless software updates across the whole cluster in a few minutes, irrespective of the size.</li> <li>Blacklisting of the executor nodes will automatically move all the running application containers to other nodes and prevent any further allocations to this node. This allows the node to be taken down for maintenance that needs longer periods of time to complete the OS/patch application, hardware maintenance, etc.</li> <li>Detect and kill any Zombie container nodes.

Some balance is anyways gained by enabling hyper-threading on the executor nodes. This should be sufficient to provide a significant boost to the application performance.</li> <li>Allows for specialised nodes in the cluster. For example, there might be nodes with GPU available. We would want to run ML models that can utilise such hardware rather than allocate generic service containers on such nodes. To this end, the scheduler supports tagging and allows for containers to be explicitly mapped to tagged nodes.</li> <li>Allows for different placement policies to provide some flexibility to users in where they want to place their container nodes. This sometimes helps developers deploy specific apps to specific nodes where they might have been granted special privileges to perform deeper than usual investigations of running service containers (for example, take heap-dumps to specific mounted volumes, etc.).</li> <li>Allows for configuration injection at container startup. Such configuration can be streamed in as part of the deployment specification, mounted in from executor hosts, or fetched via API calls by the controllers or executors.</li> <li>Provides provisions to allow for extension of the scheduler to implement different scheduling algorithms in the code later on.</li> <li>Sometimes, NUMA localization and CPU pinning are overkill for clusters that don't need to extract the last bit of performance. For example, testing/staging clusters. To this end, Drove supports the following features:<ul> <li>Allows turning off NUMA and core pinning at executor level.</li> <li>Allows to specify multipliers for available CPU/memory to accommodate overprovisioning on the cluster.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Because the above are set at an executor level, the cluster can have different types of nodes with different required performance characteristics appropriately tagged. Relevant apps can be deployed based on performance requirements.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#resilience","title":"Resilience","text":"<ul> <li>Small number of moving pieces. Keeps the minimal amount of dependencies in the system. This reduces the exposure to failures by effectively reducing the number of external dependencies and possible failure points.</li> <li>Controller stores state on external system (Zookeeper) for now.</li> <li>Executor stores all container specific states in the container metadata itself. No other state is maintained/needed by executor.</li> <li>Containers keep running even when most of the system is down. This means that even when the cluster coordinators, executors, state storage, etc. are down, the already deployed containers keep on running as is. If a service discovery mechanism is implemented properly, this effectively protects the system against service disruptions, even in the face of failure of critical cluster components. At PhonePe, we use Ranger for service discovery. </li> <li>Container state reconciliation is part of the executor system, so that executor service can be restarted easily without affecting application or task deployments. In other words, the executor needs to recognise the containers started by itself on restarts and report their state as usual to the controller.</li> <li>Keeps things as simple as possible. Drove uses a few simple constructs (scale up/scale down) and implements all application/task features using that.</li> <li>Multi-mode cluster messaging ensures that faster updates will be sent to controller via sync channels, while the controller(s) keep refreshing the cluster state periodically, irrespective of the last synced data. Drove assumes that communication failures would happen. Even if new changes can\u2019t be propagated from executor to controller, it tries to keep existing topology as updated as possible.</li> <li>Built in safeguards to detect and kill any rogue (Zombie) container instances that have remained back for some reason (maybe some bug in the orchestrator, etc.).</li> <li>Controller is highly available with one leader active at a time. Any communication issues with Zookeeper will lead to quick death of the controller so that another controller can take up its place as quickly as possible.</li> <li>Leader can be tracked using the <code>ping</code> api and is used by components such as drove-gateway to provide a Virtual Host that can be used to interact with the cluster via the UI or the CLI, and other tools.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#security","title":"Security","text":"<ul> <li>Clearly designate roles for read and write operations.

This works independent of the orchestration system in play (we were on Drove and Mesos both at the same time during the transition period) and calls APIs on the deployment system that handles scaling operations independently. Any implementation at the orchestration level will not work as the contributors to the metrics might be running on different clusters, and scaling them independently will bring in more complexities rather than solving for simplicity.</li> <li>Network level traffic control: At PhonePe, network security is handled at VRF level, and container-level access control is not needed. All services are already integrated with the OAuth2 compliant internal authentication and authorization system and perform security checks for the same at the application layer.

Instead, in Drove, there is a feature to make executors appear to have more cores (and memory) than it actually has. This can be used to get more utilization out of executor nodes in clusters that do not need guaranteed performance (for example staging or dev testing clusters). This is achieved by enabling over provisioning.</p> <p>Over provisioning needs to be configured in the executor configuration. It primarily consists of two configs:</p> <ul> <li>CPU Multiplier - an integral multiplier which will be used to multiply the number of available cores</li> <li>Memory Multiplier - an integral multiplier which will be used to multiply available memory</li> </ul> <p>VCores (virtual cores) are internal representation of a CPU core on the executor. If over provisioning is disabled, a vcore will correspond to a physical core. If over provisioning is enabled, 1 CPU core will generate <code>cpu multiplier</code> number of v cores. Drove does do <code>cpuset</code> even on containers running on nodes that have over provisioning enabled, however the physical cores that the containers get bound to are chosen at random, albeit from the same NUMA node. <code>cpuset-mem</code> is always done on the same NUMA node as well.</p> <p>Mixed clusters</p> <p>In some production clusters you might have applications that are non critical in terms of performance and are unable to utilize a full core. These can be tagged to be spun up on some nodes where over provisioning is enabled. Adopting such a cluster topology will ensure that containers that need high performance run on nodes without over provisioning and the smaller apps (like for example operations consoles etc) are run on separate nodes with over provisioning enabled. Just ensure the latter are tagged properly and during app deployment specify this tag in application spec or task spec.</p>"},{"location":"cluster/setup/executor-setup.html#disable-numa-pinning","title":"Disable NUMA Pinning","text":"<p>There is an option to disable memory and core pinning.

This means that the minimum allocation unit possible is <code>1</code> for cores. It does not support fractional CPU.</p> <p>However, there are situations where we would want some non-critical applications to run the cluster but not waste CPU. The <code>overProvisioning</code> configuration aims to provide user a way to turn off NUMA pinning on the executor and run more containers than it normally would.</p> <p>To ensure predictability, we do not want pinned and non-pinned containers running on the same host. Hence, an executor host can either be running in pinned mode or in non-pinned mode.</p> <p>To enable more containers than we could usually deploy and to still retain some level of control on how small you want a container to go, we specify multipliers on CPU and memory.</p> <p>Example: - Let's say your executor server has 40 cores available. If you set <code>cpuMultiplier</code> as 4, this node will now show up as having 160 cores to the controller. - Let's say your server had 512GB of memory, setting <code>memoryMultiplier</code> to 2 will make drove see it as 1TB.</p> Name Option Description Enabled <code>enabled</code> Set this to true to enable over provisioning.
